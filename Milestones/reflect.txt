Doing this project has been great practice to bring together all the components of OOP that was taught this semester, such as encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance. During this project the only issue I would face everytime when trying to submit through the submitter was there would be a memory leak somewhere, I would say I still have not grasped the whole idea of memory allocation and deallocation but whenever I would have a memory leak I would instantly look where I used the "new" keyword for a new variable and check if a corresponding delete is missing for that variable or not as in most cases that has been what caused the memory leak such as in the last milestone where in the load function a temp pointer to a patient was declared and we would instantiate a new covid or triage patient in that pointer as I had not included a delete for it in the function it most definitely caused a memory leak and as often I would also have an issue that the program tried to read from memory that is out of bounds. Furthermore any semantic errors I had faced were minor issues that were solved through a little debugging and errors that I could fix by just trying to understand the error intellisense would throw by reading about it on the microsoft website. The lectures would be the biggest factor in everything I have learned this semester as I was able to understand what the coding examples meant to do every lecture and why it must be done, I was able to apply most of what I grasped as best as possible to my labs and assignment very easily.
